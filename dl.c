    /*
    Our C program is a simple one that takes input for a first name and then prints it. 
    However, there is a potential issue with using %s in the scanf function, 
    which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input string is longer than the size of the array.

    To address this issue, we can use the %29s format specifier in the scanf function to limit 
    the input to 29 characters (leaving one character for the null-terminator).
